## What Is Terminex

Terminex is a intuitive, simple and cross-platform terminal made using JS.

### Installation

- Start by cloning the project from GitHub.

```terminal
git clone https://github.com/katungi/terminex.git
```

cd into the directory:

If you are on windows, run the `.bat` file by right clicking it and **_running as administrator_**

If you are running a linux distro, you will need to give the file permissions by running:

```terminal
chmod 744 npm_install.sh
```

then run it:

```terminal
./npm_install.sh
```

This will install all the dependencies you need to run the terminal.

### Running The Terminal

Once the dependencies are installed, run:

```terminal
npm start

```

## Built With

## WARNING

The project was built by a coffee-high dev in 3 hours. 1 hour of coding and 2 for debugging C++ stuff He has no idea about.

Key things to know:

- Copy and Paste functions do not work at the moment.
- I intentionally excluded ```zsh``` for further testing since it breaks when the user has a custom theme.
- Be kind with the critism ðŸ¥º
